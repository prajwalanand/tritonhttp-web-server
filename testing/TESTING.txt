For testing, we used 3 approaches:

1. netcat

We created an input request file using the printf command as:

printf "REQUEST_MESSAGE" > request.txt

REQUEST_MESSAGE is substituted with each test case message.

We follow this with a netcat command as:

cat request.txt | nc localhost 8080

The response message is shown on the console as output.

2. Python script

We used the attached Python file (testing_script.py) to test some of our test cases.

The Python file creates request messages as a byte string (msgPart1) and sends this to the server with the help of the socket module of Python.

Then we read the response and output whatever lines we receive to the console.

**Refer our writeup PDF to find all our test request messages.

3. Browser

For some test cases, we simply used the browser and entered the address http://localhost:8080/ to send a default valid request and viewed the response.

This was especially useful for rendering image files. We verified the response headers by inspecting the Network tab and viewing the response message.
